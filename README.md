**Unreal Engine GPU Point Cloud Renderer**

GPU-based Plugin for Real-Time rendering of dynamic and massive point cloud data in Unreal.

__This plugin is only for rendering point clouds and does NOT load point cloud files or visualises Kinect data.__
__For loading PCD files, processing point clouds with PCL or fetching data from a Kinect, another plugin will follow soon.__

Currently supported Unreal Versions:
* UE4.18
* UE4.19 (see other branch)

The ComputeShader-powered version for proper depth-ordering of the points is still in development (see other branch).
