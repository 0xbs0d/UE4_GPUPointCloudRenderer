**Unreal Engine GPU Point Cloud Renderer**

This is a GPU-based Plugin for Real-Time rendering of dynamic and massive point cloud data in Unreal. This project is still under development and not (yet) a finalised plugin.

__This plugin is only for rendering point clouds and does NOT load point cloud files or visualise Kinect data.__
__For loading PCD files, processing point clouds with PCL or fetching data from a Kinect, another plugin will follow soon.__

Currently supported Unreal Versions:
* __UE4.21__
* UE4.19 (see other branch)

The ComputeShader-powered version for proper in-place depth-ordering of the points is still in development (see other branch).
